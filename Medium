-- LeetCode 176: Second Highest Salary
-- Difficulty: Medium
--
-- Problem:
-- Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
-- If there is no second highest salary, the result should be NULL.
--
-- Table: Employee
-- +-------------+------+
-- | Column Name | Type |
-- +-------------+------+
-- | id          | int  |
-- | salary      | int  |
-- +-------------+------+
-- id is the primary key for this table.

-- Solution:
-- Use the DISTINCT keyword to handle duplicate salaries.
-- Use LIMIT with OFFSET to get the second highest salary.
-- Wrap in a subquery and use a SELECT to return NULL if not found.

SELECT 
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT salary 
        FROM Employee 
        ORDER BY salary DESC 
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
    ) AS SecondHighestSalary;


SELECT 
   MAX(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM 
  Employee 
WHERE 
  salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
