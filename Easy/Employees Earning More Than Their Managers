-- LeetCode 181: Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
-- Difficulty: Easy
--
-- Problem:
-- The Employee table holds all employees including their managers.
-- Write a query to find the names of employees who earn more than their managers.
--
-- Table: Employee
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | name        | varchar |
-- | salary      | int     |
-- | managerId   | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key.
-- managerId is a foreign key referencing id of another employee.

-- Solution:
-- Perform a self-join on the Employee table:
--   - Join employee (e) with their manager (m) where e.managerId = m.id
--   - Filter where e.salary > m.salary
-- Return the names of such employees.

SELECT 
    e.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee m 
    ON e.managerId = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;
